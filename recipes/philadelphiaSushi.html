    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Put rice into a large deep bowl. Fill with cold water and rub rice together with 
            hands until water turns milky white. Drain cloudy water, being careful not to pour 
            out rice. Repeat three or four times until you can see rice through 3 inches of water; 
            drain once more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer rice to a saucepan; add kombu and 3 cups water. Let stand 30 minutes. 
            Cover; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer 10 minutes. 
            Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, stir together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl until dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove and discard kombu; stir in vinegar mixture until no lumps remain. Spread rice mixture 
            onto a rimmed 9x13 baking sheet. Let cool to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            Trim and quarter half a cucumber. Thinly slice each quarter lengthwise to make 8 spears. Cut 4 oz. 
            cream cheese into 4 sticks. After spreading rice on nori, sprinkle each roll 
            with 1 tsp. each white sesame seeds and black sesame seeds. Carefully flip over. Arrange 2 oz. 
            cold smoked salmon, the cucumber, and cream cheese sticks in a line across the sheet about one-third 
            from the top. Roll and cut as directed. Makes 4 rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lay one sheet of nori on a sushi mat lined with plastic wrap; spread 1 cup of rice over 
            nori with damp fingers, leaving a 1-inch border along one edge. Arrange desired fillings 
            crosswise just off center of rice. Carefully lift filled edge of nori and roll over filling 
            toward unfilled edge, tucking as you roll. Brush unfilled edge of nori with water; press to seal. 
            Cut each roll into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining nori, rice, and fillings. To make ahead, chill, 
            covered, up to 4 hours.
